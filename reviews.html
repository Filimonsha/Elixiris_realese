          We want you to rest assured that the Elixiris process works. We hope
          you can relate to one or more of the asthma histories in these reviews

          you.

                  “I have had asthma for about 15 years. It was mild at first
                  but became very severe in the last 3 years. I had to
                  eventually quit my job because it was so severe. With the
                  severity, I have had to take a lot of medication, to breathe.
                  <br /><br />
                  I tried to improve my symptoms with various methods, but
                  nothing worked. I tried salt caves, but they irritated my
                  lungs and made me feel worse. I also tried breathing
                  exercises, paying for an expensive set of courses, but they
                  did not help either.
                  <br /><br />
                  Some weeks ago I started slowly implementing the Elixiris
                  process. Before I started the process, I could not walk far.
                  My family even had to cook outside because the vapours
                  exacerbated my breathing difficulties. Now, I am able to go
                  for long walks, do more things around my home, and even cook
                  for my family - indoors! I have been able to reduce my
                  medication as well!
                  <br /><br />
                  I feel my lungs are healing. They feel so much better now. I
                  have less pain, less mucus, and I feel ease of my symptoms. I
                  am continuing the Elixiris process and am excited about making
                  further improvements!”
